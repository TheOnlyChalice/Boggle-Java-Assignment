# Boggle Player â€“ Assignment Project

This project implements and evaluates a **Boggle player** that finds valid words on a 4Ã—4 board using a dictionary. The program combines efficient data structures, depth-first search, and evaluation metrics to measure solver performance.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files
- `BogglePlayer.java` â€“ core solver, builds a dictionary tree and searches for words with DFS
- `EvalBogglePlayer.java` â€“ driver program to generate boards and score results
- `Word.java` â€“ represents words and their board paths
- `Location.java` â€“ stores row/column positions on the board
- `words.txt` â€“ dictionary of valid words

## ðŸŽ® Features
- Preprocess dictionary into a tree for fast lookups
- Handles special rules like `Q â†’ QU`
- Finds unique words of length â‰¥3
- Evaluates based on **points, speed, and memory**
- Scoring formula:  
  \[(pointsÂ²) / âˆš(time Ã— memory)\]

## ðŸš€ Run Instructions
Compile and run the driver:

```bash
javac *.java
java EvalBogglePlayer
